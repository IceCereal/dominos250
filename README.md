## Why name it Dominos 250?

<i>Sigh...</i> It was all a spur of the moment. We were organizing a hackathon and we needed to get food for around 250 participants. After thinking, we decided to go to Domino's Pizza and order 250 pizzas. The only way to make these pizza's for us was by shutting down the shop and focusing on our large order. Of course, 250 pizzas take a couple of hours to make. We had 2 and a half hours and a laptop.
