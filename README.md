## Why name it Dominos 250?

<i>Sigh...</i> It was all a spur of the moment. We were organizing a hackathon and we needed to get food for around 250 participants. After thinking, we decided to go to Domino's Pizza and order 250 pizzas. The only way to make these pizza's for us was by shutting down the shop and focusing on our large order. Of course, 250 pizzas take a couple of hours to make. We had 2 and a half hours and a laptop.

## What is Dominos 250?

An Add-on (Mozilla Firefox) that aims to change the way search engines display results. The new and interactive display would be applicable for all search engines. The results would be displayed as HTML (Bootstrap4) cards. The title of the website, a short descriptive portion of the website and the link would be displayed in the card. These look like dominos when put next to each other.
